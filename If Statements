#Exercise 1
#Part a. The code does not work because an indent is expected for the line after the "if" function.

#Part b. The code does not recognise "Y" as "y" because it is case-sensitive, so it would regard it is not raining.

#Part c. If in the code it is typed out as "Y" and the input is also "Y", then the code would work as intended.

#Exercise 2
test = input("Is it raining? y/n ")
if test in ["y","Y","Yes","yes"]:
    print("Oh dear, no football today!")

#Exercise 3
#The second line of the code should be indented after the "if" function line.

else:
  print("Great we can play!")
